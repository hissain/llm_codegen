Research indicates a significant interest in optimizing LoRaWAN for direct device-to-device communication to reduce latency and dependence on network infrastructure. Studies are focusing on improving power efficiency through novel modulation techniques and protocol adaptations. Security aspects are also being addressed, with researchers proposing lightweight encryption schemes suitable for constrained devices. Several papers explore different hardware and software implementations of on-device LoRa, highlighting trade-offs between performance and energy consumption.  Further work is needed to standardize implementations and improve interoperability among various on-device LoRa solutions.  The findings suggest promising potential for on-device LoRa in applications requiring low-power, long-range communication with minimal infrastructure.  Addressing scalability and security concerns remains crucial for wider adoption.\\n\\n\"\n",
