      "* **Scoring Mechanism:** The paper selection now uses a simple scoring system to prioritize papers based on keyword matches in both title and abstract. This allows for a more nuanced selection process.\n",
      "* **Expanded Keywords:**  Added \"quantum support vector machine\" to the keywords.\n",
      "* **Improved Methodology Extraction:** The regex now searches both title and summary for methodologies.\n",
      "* **IEEE-like References:**  Added formatted references using a numbering system.\n",
      "* **Clearer Formatting:** Added extra newlines (`\\n\\n`) to separate paper summaries and methodology descriptions.\n",
      "* **More Comprehensive `max_results`:** Increased to 25 for a broader initial search.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Okay, let's continue enhancing the code to improve the analysis and presentation of the technical review.  We'll focus on these aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **More Robust Methodology Analysis:** Instead of a simple regular expression, we'll attempt to extract more detailed information about the methodologies used, including specific algorithm names if possible.  This will require more sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) techniques, but we'll start with a basic improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Categorization of Research:**  We'll group the key papers based on their primary focus (e.g., variational quantum algorithms, quantum kernel methods, etc.) for better organization in the review.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Enhanced PDF Formatting:** We'll adjust the PDF generation to improve readability and visual appeal, such as adding section headings with better styling and potentially using a different font.\n",
