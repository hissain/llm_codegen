      "To reiterate the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ensure Python and `pip` are installed:** Make sure you have a working Python environment.  If you are unsure if you have it installed, search for \"python\" in your start menu (Windows) or use a terminal command like `python --version` (Linux/macOS).  If it's not installed, download and install the latest version from python.org.  Make sure to add Python to your PATH environment variable (important for running it easily from the command line).\n",
      "2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**  It's best practice to work within a virtual environment.  This isolates your project's dependencies and prevents conflicts with other Python projects. Create one using `python -m venv .venv` (replace `.venv` with your desired virtual environment name), and activate it using `.venv\\Scripts\\activate` (Windows) or `source .venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux).\n",
      "3. **Install `fpdf2`:** Run `pip install fpdf2` inside the activated virtual environment to install the PDF generation library.\n",
      "4. **Save the Python code:** Copy the Python code I provided earlier and save it as a `.py` file (e.g., `create_pdf.py`).\n",
      "5. **Paste your review:** Open `create_pdf.py` and paste your complete review text into the `review_text` variable. Be sure to maintain the proper formatting and paragraph breaks.\n",
      "6. **Run the script:**  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file in your terminal and run `python create_pdf.py`.\n",
      "7. **Check your PDF:**  The `quantum_machine_learning_review.pdf` file should be created in the same directory.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you still have trouble, please provide specifics:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Operating system:** (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n",
      "* **Python version:** (Check using `python --version`)\n",
      "* **Exact error message:** (Copy and paste the full error message if you get one.)\n",
      "* **Your code:** If you've modified the code, please share the modified version.\n",
