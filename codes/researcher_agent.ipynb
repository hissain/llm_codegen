The\\\\nresulting vector magnetic field is compared to the expected Earth\\'s magnetic\\\\nfield for their location. The second experiment uses the phone sensors to\\\\nmeasure the magnet field produced by the small magnet found in the speaker of\\\\ncommon earbuds, or in-ear headphones. The students then carefully investigate\\\\nthe dependence of the magnitude of the field on the axial distance between the\\\\nspeaker magnet and the phone\\'s sensors.

However, due to the interference from head movement or\\\\nbackground noise, commonly-used modalities (e.g. accelerometer and microphone)\\\\nfail to reliably detect both intense and light motions. To obviate this, we\\\\npropose OESense, an acoustic-based in-ear system for general human motion\\\\nsensing. The core idea behind OESense is the joint use of the occlusion effect\\\\n(i.e., the enhancement of low-frequency components of bone-conducted sounds in\\\\nan occluded ear canal) and inward-facing microphone, which naturally boosts the\\\\nsensing signal and suppresses external interference. We prototype OESense as an\\\\nearbud and evaluate its performance on three representative applications, i.e.,\\\\nstep counting, activity recognition, and hand-to-face gesture interaction. With\\\\ndata collected from 31 subjects, we show that OESense achieves 99.3% step\\\\ncounting recall, 98.3% recognition recall for 5 activities, and 97.0% recall\\\\nfor five tapping gestures on human face, respectively. We also demonstrate that\\\\nOESense is compatible with earbuds\\' fundamental functionalities (e.g. music\\\\nplayback and phone calls). In terms of energy, OESense consumes 746 mW during\\\\ndata recording and recognition and it has a response latency of 40.85 ms for\\\\ngesture recognition. Our analysis indicates such overhead is acceptable and\\\\nOESense is potential to be integrated into future earbuds.\", \\'pdf_url\\': \\'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08607v1\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Eve Said Yes: AirBone Authentication for Head-Wearable Smart Voice Assistant\\', \\'authors\\': [\\'Chenpei Huang\\', \\'Hui Zhong\\', \\'Jie Lian\\', \\'Pavana Prakash\\', \\'Dian Shi\\', \\'Yuan Xu\\', \\'Miao Pan\\'], \\'published\\': \\'2023-09-26\\', \\'abstract\\': \"Recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing have\\\\nfostered the enormous prosperity of smart voice assistants and their services,\\\\ne.g., Alexa, Google Home, Siri, etc. However, voice spoofing attacks are deemed\\\\nto be one of the major challenges of voice control security, and never stop\\\\nevolving such as deep-learning-based voice conversion and speech synthesis\\\\ntechniques. To solve this problem outside the acoustic domain, we focus on\\\\nhead-wearable devices, such as earbuds and virtual reality (VR) headsets, which\\\\nare feasible to continuously monitor the bone-conducted voice in the vibration\\\\ndomain. Specifically, we identify that air and bone conduction (AC/BC) from the\\\\nsame vocalization are coupled (or concurrent) and user-level unique, which\\\\nmakes them suitable behavior and biometric factors for multi-factor\\\\nauthentication (MFA). The legitimate user can defeat acoustic domain and even\\\\ncross-domain spoofing samples with the proposed two-stage AirBone\\\\nauthentication. The first stage answers \\\\\\\\textit{whether air and bone conduction\\\\nutterances are time domain consistent (TC)} and the second stage runs\\\\n\\\\\\\\textit{bone conduction speaker recognition (BC-SR)}. The security level is\\\\nhence increased for two reasons: (1) current acoustic attacks on smart voice\\\\nassistants cannot affect bone conduction, which is in the vibration domain; (2)\\\\neven for advanced cross-domain attacks, the unique bone conduction features can\\\\ndetect adversary\\'s impersonation and machine-induced vibration. Finally,\\\\nAirBone authentication has good usability (the same level as voice\\\\nauthentication) compared with traditional MFA and those specially designed to\\\\nenhance smart voice security.

All\\ntransducers showed degradation already after the first cycle, and no\\ntransducers produced a measurable signal after the sixth LC. The degradation\\neffects were detectable in both, the professional microphone as well as the\\nsmartphone recordings. We hope that the present work is a first step in\\nestablishing a practical, and ecologically valid method for everyday users to\\nassess the degree of degradation of their personal earbuds.\", 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02151v1'}, {'title': 'ClearBuds: Wireless Binaural Earbuds for Learning-Based Speech Enhancement', 'authors': ['Ishan Chatterjee', 'Maruchi Kim', 'Vivek Jayaram', 'Shyamnath Gollakota', 'Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman', 'Shwetak Patel', 'Steven M.

To solve this problem outside the acoustic domain, we focus on\\nhead-wearable devices, such as earbuds and virtual reality (VR) headsets, which\\nare feasible to continuously monitor the bone-conducted voice in the vibration\\ndomain. Specifically, we identify that air and bone conduction (AC/BC) from the\\nsame vocalization are coupled (or concurrent) and user-level unique, which\\nmakes them suitable behavior and biometric factors for multi-factor\\nauthentication (MFA). The legitimate user can defeat acoustic domain and even\\ncross-domain spoofing samples with the proposed two-stage AirBone\\nauthentication. The first stage answers \\\\textit{whether air and bone conduction\\nutterances are time domain consistent (TC)} and the second stage runs\\n\\\\textit{bone conduction speaker recognition (BC-SR)}. The security level is\\nhence increased for two reasons: (1) current acoustic attacks on smart voice\\nassistants cannot affect bone conduction, which is in the vibration domain; (2)\\neven for advanced cross-domain attacks, the unique bone conduction features can\\ndetect adversary's impersonation and machine-induced vibration. Finally,\\nAirBone authentication has good usability (the same level as voice\\nauthentication) compared with traditional MFA and those specially designed to\\nenhance smart voice security. Our experimental results show that the proposed\\nAirBone authentication is usable and secure, and can be easily equipped by\\ncommercial off-the-shelf head wearables with good user experience.\", 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15203v1'}]\n",

      "[FunctionCall(id='', arguments='{\"content\":\"# Advanced Features in Earbuds and AirPods: A Literature Review (2022-2024)\\\\n\\\\n## Introduction\\\\n\\\\nThis literature review focuses on the advancements in features of earbuds and AirPods over the past two years (2022-2024). The review covers improvements in audio quality, noise cancellation, human motion sensing, and security features.\\\\n\\\\n## Audio Quality and Speech Enhancement\\\\n\\\\nOne of the primary areas of advancement has been in improving audio quality and speech enhancement. Chatterjee et al. (2022) introduced ClearBuds, a system using a neural network to enhance speech streamed from wireless earbuds, with a synchronized binaural microphone array and a lightweight dual-channel speech enhancement neural network running on a mobile device [1]. This system notably reduces artifacts in the audio output. Apple\\'s AirPods Pro 2 also features the H2 chip, designed to communicate at high speed to unlock a revolutionary new format rendering pure, uncompressed sound in real time [5].\\\\n\\\\n## Active Noise Cancellation and Hearing Health\\\\n\\\\nActive Noise Cancellation (ANC) remains a key area of focus. Apple has introduced a hearing health experience with AirPods Pro 2, indicating ongoing development in integrating health-related features into earbuds [2].\\\\n\\\\n## Human Motion Sensing\\\\n\\\\nEarbuds are evolving into wearable platforms for personal-scale human motion sensing. Ma et al. (2021) proposed OESense, an acoustic-based in-ear system that utilizes the occlusion effect and an inward-facing microphone for general human motion sensing. This system has been shown to reliably detect both intense and light motions, with applications in step counting, activity recognition, and hand-to-face gesture interaction [4].\\\\n\\\\n## Security Features\\\\n\\\\nWith the increasing use of voice assistants, security has become a crucial aspect. Huang et al. (2023) introduced AirBone authentication for head-wearable smart voice assistants, focusing on the coupling of air and bone conduction from the same vocalization for multi-factor authentication. This approach aims to defend against voice spoofing attacks by leveraging the unique bone conduction features of a user\\'s voice [3].\\\\n\\\\n## Other Considerations\\\\n\\\\nWhile advancements are being made, degradation of earbuds is a concern. Beveridge et al. (2020) investigated the degradation effects of water immersion on earbud audio quality, finding significant degradation in terms of RMS noise loudness, Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), and changes in frequency responses after laundering [6].\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nThe past two years have seen significant advancements in earbud and AirPod technology, with improvements spanning audio quality, noise cancellation, human motion sensing, and security. These advancements aim to enhance user experience, improve health monitoring capabilities, and provide more secure interactions with voice assistants.\\\\n\\\\n## References\\\\n\\\\n[1] Chatterjee, I., Kim, M., Jayaram, V., Gollakota, S., Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, I., Patel, S., & Seitz, S.

These experiments were initially developed for\\\\nstudents working remotely in an online course setting. However, the experiments\\\\ncan also be used for in-person laboratory activities. The first activity uses\\\\nthe phone\\'s three-dimensional sensors to determine the vector components and\\\\norientation of the background magnetic field at the students\\' locations. The\\\\nresulting vector magnetic field is compared to the expected Earth\\'s magnetic\\\\nfield for their location. The second experiment uses the phone sensors to\\\\nmeasure the magnet field produced by the small magnet found in the speaker of\\\\ncommon earbuds, or in-ear headphones. The students then carefully investigate\\\\nthe dependence of the magnitude of the field on the axial distance between the\\\\nspeaker magnet and the phone\\'s sensors.

However, due to the interference from head movement or\\\\nbackground noise, commonly-used modalities (e.g. accelerometer and microphone)\\\\nfail to reliably detect both intense and light motions. To obviate this, we\\\\npropose OESense, an acoustic-based in-ear system for general human motion\\\\nsensing. The core idea behind OESense is the joint use of the occlusion effect\\\\n(i.e., the enhancement of low-frequency components of bone-conducted sounds in\\\\nan occluded ear canal) and inward-facing microphone, which naturally boosts the\\\\nsensing signal and suppresses external interference. We prototype OESense as an\\\\nearbud and evaluate its performance on three representative applications, i.e.,\\\\nstep counting, activity recognition, and hand-to-face gesture interaction. With\\\\ndata collected from 31 subjects, we show that OESense achieves 99.3% step\\\\ncounting recall, 98.3% recognition recall for 5 activities, and 97.0% recall\\\\nfor five tapping gestures on human face, respectively. We also demonstrate that\\\\nOESense is compatible with earbuds\\' fundamental functionalities (e.g. music\\\\nplayback and phone calls). In terms of energy, OESense consumes 746 mW during\\\\ndata recording and recognition and it has a response latency of 40.85 ms for\\\\ngesture recognition. Our analysis indicates such overhead is acceptable and\\\\nOESense is potential to be integrated into future earbuds.\", \\'pdf_url\\': \\'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08607v1\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Eve Said Yes: AirBone Authentication for Head-Wearable Smart Voice Assistant\\', \\'authors\\': [\\'Chenpei Huang\\', \\'Hui Zhong\\', \\'Jie Lian\\', \\'Pavana Prakash\\', \\'Dian Shi\\', \\'Yuan Xu\\', \\'Miao Pan\\'], \\'published\\': \\'2023-09-26\\', \\'abstract\\': \"Recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing have\\\\nfostered the enormous prosperity of smart voice assistants and their services,\\\\ne.g., Alexa, Google Home, Siri, etc. However, voice spoofing attacks are deemed\\\\nto be one of the major challenges of voice control security, and never stop\\\\nevolving such as deep-learning-based voice conversion and speech synthesis\\\\ntechniques. To solve this problem outside the acoustic domain, we focus on\\\\nhead-wearable devices, such as earbuds and virtual reality (VR) headsets, which\\\\nare feasible to continuously monitor the bone-conducted voice in the vibration\\\\ndomain. Specifically, we identify that air and bone conduction (AC/BC) from the\\\\nsame vocalization are coupled (or concurrent) and user-level unique, which\\\\nmakes them suitable behavior and biometric factors for multi-factor\\\\nauthentication (MFA). The legitimate user can defeat acoustic domain and even\\\\ncross-domain spoofing samples with the proposed two-stage AirBone\\\\nauthentication. The first stage answers \\\\\\\\textit{whether air and bone conduction\\\\nutterances are time domain consistent (TC)} and the second stage runs\\\\n\\\\\\\\textit{bone conduction speaker recognition (BC-SR)}. The security level is\\\\nhence increased for two reasons: (1) current acoustic attacks on smart voice\\\\nassistants cannot affect bone conduction, which is in the vibration domain; (2)\\\\neven for advanced cross-domain attacks, the unique bone conduction features can\\\\ndetect adversary\\'s impersonation and machine-induced vibration. Finally,\\\\nAirBone authentication has good usability (the same level as voice\\\\nauthentication) compared with traditional MFA and those specially designed to\\\\nenhance smart voice security. Our experimental results show that the proposed\\\\nAirBone authentication is usable and secure, and can be easily equipped by\\\\ncommercial off-the-shelf head wearables with good user experience.\", \\'pdf_url\\': \\'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15203v1\\'}]', call_id='', is_error=False), FunctionExecutionResult(content='[{\\'kind\\': \\'customsearch#result\\', \\'title\\': \\'Mass production of two new AirPods models to start in May ...\\', \\'htmlTitle\\': \\'Mass production of two <b>new AirPods</b> models to start <b>in</b> May ...\\', \\'link\\': \\'https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1bh2wxd/mass_production_of_two_new_airpods_models_to/\\', \\'displayLink\\': \\'www.reddit.com\\', \\'snippet\\': \"Mar 17, 2024 ...

In a\\\\nuser-study with 37 participants who spent over 15.4 hours rating 1041 audio\\\\nsamples collected in-the-wild, our system achieves improved mean opinion score\\\\nand background noise suppression.\\\\n  Project page with demos: https://clearbuds.cs.washington.edu\\', \\'pdf_url\\': \\'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13611v1\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Magnetic Field Experiments Using a Phone\\', \\'authors\\': [\\'Glen D.

These experiments were initially developed for\\\\nstudents working remotely in an online course setting. However, the experiments\\\\ncan also be used for in-person laboratory activities. The first activity uses\\\\nthe phone\\'s three-dimensional sensors to determine the vector components and\\\\norientation of the background magnetic field at the students\\' locations. The\\\\nresulting vector magnetic field is compared to the expected Earth\\'s magnetic\\\\nfield for their location. The second experiment uses the phone sensors to\\\\nmeasure the magnet field produced by the small magnet found in the speaker of\\\\ncommon earbuds, or in-ear headphones. The students then carefully investigate\\\\nthe dependence of the magnitude of the field on the axial distance between the\\\\nspeaker magnet and the phone\\'s sensors. Using a ring magnet approximation,\\\\nadvanced Excel curve-fitting methods are introduced to determine the radius of\\\\nthe magnet in the earbud and the distance between the magnet\\'s location and the\\\\nexternal surface of the earbud housing.\", \\'pdf_url\\': \\'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02258v1\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'OESense: Employing Occlusion Effect for In-ear Human Sensing\\', \\'authors\\': [\\'Dong Ma\\', \\'Andrea Ferlini\\', \\'Cecilia Mascolo\\'], \\'published\\': \\'2021-06-16\\', \\'abstract\\': \"Smart earbuds are recognized as a new wearable platform for personal-scale\\\\nhuman motion sensing. However, due to the interference from head movement or\\\\nbackground noise, commonly-used modalities (e.g. accelerometer and microphone)\\\\nfail to reliably detect both intense and light motions. To obviate this, we\\\\npropose OESense, an acoustic-based in-ear system for general human motion\\\\nsensing. The core idea behind OESense is the joint use of the occlusion effect\\\\n(i.e., the enhancement of low-frequency components of bone-conducted sounds in\\\\nan occluded ear canal) and inward-facing microphone, which naturally boosts the\\\\nsensing signal and suppresses external interference. We prototype OESense as an\\\\nearbud and evaluate its performance on three representative applications, i.e.,\\\\nstep counting, activity recognition, and hand-to-face gesture interaction. With\\\\ndata collected from 31 subjects, we show that OESense achieves 99.3% step\\\\ncounting recall, 98.3% recognition recall for 5 activities, and 97.0% recall\\\\nfor five tapping gestures on human face, respectively. We also demonstrate that\\\\nOESense is compatible with earbuds\\' fundamental functionalities (e.g. music\\\\nplayback and phone calls). In terms of energy, OESense consumes 746 mW during\\\\ndata recording and recognition and it has a response latency of 40.85 ms for\\\\ngesture recognition.

To solve this problem outside the acoustic domain, we focus on\\\\nhead-wearable devices, such as earbuds and virtual reality (VR) headsets, which\\\\nare feasible to continuously monitor the bone-conducted voice in the vibration\\\\ndomain. Specifically, we identify that air and bone conduction (AC/BC) from the\\\\nsame vocalization are coupled (or concurrent) and user-level unique, which\\\\nmakes them suitable behavior and biometric factors for multi-factor\\\\nauthentication (MFA). The legitimate user can defeat acoustic domain and even\\\\ncross-domain spoofing samples with the proposed two-stage AirBone\\\\nauthentication. The first stage answers \\\\\\\\textit{whether air and bone conduction\\\\nutterances are time domain consistent (TC)} and the second stage runs\\\\n\\\\\\\\textit{bone conduction speaker recognition (BC-SR)}.

The review covers improvements in audio quality, noise cancellation, human motion sensing, and security features.\\\\n\\\\n## Audio Quality and Speech Enhancement\\\\n\\\\nOne of the primary areas of advancement has been in improving audio quality and speech enhancement. Chatterjee et al. (2022) introduced ClearBuds, a system using a neural network to enhance speech streamed from wireless earbuds, with a synchronized binaural microphone array and a lightweight dual-channel speech enhancement neural network running on a mobile device [1]. This system notably reduces artifacts in the audio output. Apple\\'s AirPods Pro 2 also features the H2 chip, designed to communicate at high speed to unlock a revolutionary new format rendering pure, uncompressed sound in real time [5].\\\\n\\\\n## Active Noise Cancellation and Hearing Health\\\\n\\\\nActive Noise Cancellation (ANC) remains a key area of focus. Apple has introduced a hearing health experience with AirPods Pro 2, indicating ongoing development in integrating health-related features into earbuds [2].\\\\n\\\\n## Human Motion Sensing\\\\n\\\\nEarbuds are evolving into wearable platforms for personal-scale human motion sensing. Ma et al. (2021) proposed OESense, an acoustic-based in-ear system that utilizes the occlusion effect and an inward-facing microphone for general human motion sensing. This system has been shown to reliably detect both intense and light motions, with applications in step counting, activity recognition, and hand-to-face gesture interaction [4].\\\\n\\\\n## Security Features\\\\n\\\\nWith the increasing use of voice assistants, security has become a crucial aspect. Huang et al. (2023) introduced AirBone authentication for head-wearable smart voice assistants, focusing on the coupling of air and bone conduction from the same vocalization for multi-factor authentication. This approach aims to defend against voice spoofing attacks by leveraging the unique bone conduction features of a user\\'s voice [3].\\\\n\\\\n## Other Considerations\\\\n\\\\nWhile advancements are being made, degradation of earbuds is a concern. Beveridge et al. (2020) investigated the degradation effects of water immersion on earbud audio quality, finding significant degradation in terms of RMS noise loudness, Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), and changes in frequency responses after laundering [6].\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nThe past two years have seen significant advancements in earbud and AirPod technology, with improvements spanning audio quality, noise cancellation, human motion sensing, and security. These advancements aim to enhance user experience, improve health monitoring capabilities, and provide more secure interactions with voice assistants.\\\\n\\\\n## References\\\\n\\\\n[1] Chatterjee, I., Kim, M., Jayaram, V., Gollakota, S., Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, I., Patel, S., & Seitz, S.
