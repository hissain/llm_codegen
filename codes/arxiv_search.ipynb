       "  'authors': ['Ziheng Ouyang', 'Zhen Li', 'Qibin Hou'],\n",
       "  'summary': 'Recent studies have explored combining different LoRAs to jointly generate\\nlearned style and content. However, existing methods either fail to effectively\\npreserve both the original subject and style simultaneously or require\\nadditional training. In this paper, we argue that the intrinsic properties of\\nLoRA can effectively guide diffusion models in merging learned subject and\\nstyle. Building on this insight, we propose K-LoRA, a simple yet effective\\ntraining-free LoRA fusion approach. In each attention layer, K-LoRA compares\\nthe Top-K elements in each LoRA to be fused, determining which LoRA to select\\nfor optimal fusion. This selection mechanism ensures that the most\\nrepresentative features of both subject and style are retained during the\\nfusion process, effectively balancing their contributions. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that the proposed method effectively integrates the subject and\\nstyle information learned by the original LoRAs, outperforming state-of-the-art\\ntraining-based approaches in both qualitative and quantitative results.',\n",
